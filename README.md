## What is a Ledger?
In bookkeeping and accounting, a ledger is a book (or record) for collecting historical transaction data from a journal and organizing entries by account.

The ledger provides the transaction history and current balance in each accounting system account, throughout the accounting period. At the end of the period, ledgers, therefore, serve as the authoritative source of data for building a firm's financial accounting reports.

The Income statement is mostly a summary of account activity for the period in the firm's Revenue and Expense Accounts.
The Balance sheet is mostly a summary of the current balances in the firm's Assets, Liabilities, and Equities accounts, as they stand at the period end.
Sections below further define, explain and illustrate ledger in context with related terms and concepts, emphasizing three themes:

First, the ledger's role in the accounting cycle, the nature of posting, and practices in "continuous accounting."
Second, how firms record and organize transactions of various kinds through the jJournal, Sub-Ledger, and General Ledger.
Third, Ledger structure and contents, including the T-account Structure
